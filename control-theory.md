  - premise: Larry (needs ID) often says, "Practice doesn't make perfect, practice makes
    automatic"
    affirmation: It is true that practice will automatize *something*
    extension: "Mindless" motor control will, at the most basic level, identify
    useful elements of the control space and refine the movement, increasing
    reliability, precision, etc. (cf. [Fitts' law] and sequelae)
  - Motor practice operates within a heterarchy of control
    - Basic notion of force vs. work (consider pulleys and weights)
        - But oppositional (cross-motivated) forces cancel and do not produce
          work
        - Organisms must stay within the metabolic budget afforded by food
          sources, etc.
        - All organisms will naturally seek to minimize force / work ratio at
          the lowest (~most evolutionarily established / fast / cheap) levels
    - Extend to servo control, in which force / time may not be specified
      (often "as fast as possible")
      - Experiential example of servo control is saccades_
      - More general research program initiated by Graziano_
      - Experiential compare / contrast with different proposed movements of
        arm (continuous vs. targeted). Introduce imaginative game of arm lifted
        by an imaginary baloon (opportunity to note who has "strong" imagery)
    - That last bit especially, but actually all of this demonstrates
      connection to the conceptual domain.
      - What is the process wherein we map vibrations of the air into movement?
      - What is the translation from the concept of a movement itself to
        orthogonal movements of the breath, vocal chords and mouth?
